<!-- 
  Button conform seems to not need ".button.confirm" because it's not a child. Where as the text child does need ".text.child" because it's explicitly a 
  child of the .text class. Removing the . before button seems to be like the previous lesson where it just specifies that only "button confirm" gets the properties, 
  there's no ancestor/child relationship involved.
