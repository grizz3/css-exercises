  Simply needed to put the classes .avatar._____ in the CSS stylesheet. 
  Initially wasn't sure what the point of the .avatar class is since it doesn't seem to be defined anywhere. But if you remove it, the proportioned and distorted 
  classes get applied to the originals as well. Point seems to be that even though avatar itself is never defined in CSS, it makes sure it's only applied to the
  html that specifies avatar.
